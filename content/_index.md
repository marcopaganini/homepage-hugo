This is my personal website. Back in the day it used to have content, but then people stopped
reading personal websites and moved on to blogs. I converted it into a blog but had no time to
update it. At the same time, people gave up reading blogs and now spend all their time
posting personal information of no interest on social websites. :) With that in mind, I converted
this page to become a simple placeholder of personal links and information.

## Solo Mojave & Death Valley trip 2015

With two weeks of vacation my hands, I decided that a week-long visit to the
desert was in order.  Since I was alone, this was mostly a "leisure" trip, with
short hikes over known spots.  Also, unlike the previous trips where we
had an RV, this time decided to stay in a local hotel and do day trips, coming
back at night after some cooling off watching the stars.

## Mojave Desert 2013

I managed to take a few days off and hit the desert again with some friends in Feb/2013.
Since my available time was short, we decided to stay on what we considered the most
enjoyable sites of 2010. Sadly, Mitchell Caverns has been closed to the public due to
the California fund shortage and vandalism (way to go government and people of California,
way to go...). So far, I only managed to process and upload the first two days of this trip.

## Griswold Hills & New Idria

With only two days to spare, we took an RV and drove around Griswold Hills and New Idria,
a ghost town in Central California. We then moved on to [Pinnacles National Park](http://www.nps.gov/pinn/index.htm) (pictures not uploaded yet.)

## Mojave Desert 2010

I love desertic landscapes. Here you'll find some commented photologs of relatively
recent visits to the Mojave Desert in Southern California.
