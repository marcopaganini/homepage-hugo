## Solo Mojave & Death Valley trip 2015

With two weeks of vacation my hands, I decided that a week-long visit to the
desert was in order.  Since I was alone, this was mostly a "leisure" trip, with
short hikes over known spots.  Also, unlike the previous trips where we had an
RV, this time decided to stay in a local hotel and do day trips, coming back at
night after some cooling off watching the stars.

## Mojave Desert 2013

I managed to take a few days off and hit the desert again with some friends in
Feb/2013.  Since my available time was short, we decided to stay on what we
considered the most enjoyable sites of 2010. Sadly, Mitchell Caverns has been
closed to the public due to the California fund shortage and vandalism (way to
go government and people of California, way to go...). So far, I only managed
to process and upload the first two days of this trip.

## Griswold Hills & New Idria

With only two days to spare, we took an RV and drove around Griswold Hills and
New Idria, a ghost town in Central California. We then moved on to [Pinnacles
National Park](http://www.nps.gov/pinn/index.htm) (pictures not uploaded yet.)

## Mojave Desert 2010

I love desertic landscapes. Here you'll find some commented photologs of
relatively recent visits to the Mojave Desert in Southern California.
